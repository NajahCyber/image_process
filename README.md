CNN
This code sets up a basic CNN using TensorFlow/Keras. It loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, normalizes the pixel values, constructs the CNN architecture, compiles the model, and trains it for 10 epochs.
Here's what the output indicates:

Epochs: The training is performed over 10 epochs (Epoch 1/10 to Epoch 10/10).

Training Progress: For each epoch, it displays the training and validation metrics:

loss: The loss on the training set decreases over epochs, which is a good sign, indicating that the model is learning.
accuracy: The training accuracy also increases, suggesting that the model is getting better at classifying images in the training set.
val_loss: The loss on the validation set (val_loss) and its corresponding accuracy (val_accuracy) show how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Based on the output provided, it seems that the model's accuracy on the validation set (val_accuracy) is around 70-71% after 10 epochs. This value indicates the accuracy of your model on the unseen test data.

Keep in mind:

The accuracy might vary based on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and dataset size.
You can further analyze the model's performance by evaluating it on the test set or by visualizing more detailed metrics like confusion matrices, precision, recall, etc., to have a comprehensive understanding of its performance.
